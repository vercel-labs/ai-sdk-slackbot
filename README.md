## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens.

### 5. Deploy your app

```sh
pnpm i -g vercel
pnpm vercel dev --listen 3000 --yes
```

```sh
npx untun@latest tunnel http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure to modify the [subscription URL](./README.md/#enable-slack-events) to the `untun` URL.

> Note: you may encounter issues locally with `waitUntil`. This is being investigated.

## Production Deployment

   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `EXA_API_KEY`

## Usage

The bot will respond to:

1. Direct messages - Send a DM to your bot
2. Mentions - Mention your bot in a channel using `@YourBotName`

The bot maintains context within both threads and direct messages, so it can follow along with the conversation.

### Available Tools

1. **Weather Tool**: The bot can fetch real-time weather information for any location.

   - Example: "What's the weather like in London right now?"

2. **Web Search**: The bot can search the web for up-to-date information using [Exa](https://exa.ai).
   - Example: "Search for the latest news about AI technology"
   - You can also specify a domain: "Search for the latest sports news on bbc.com"

### Extending with New Tools

The chatbot is built with an extensible architecture using the [AI SDK's tool system](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling). You can easily add new tools such as:

- Knowledge base search
- Database queries
- Custom API integrations
- Company documentation search

To add a new tool, extend the tools object in the `lib/ai.ts` file following the existing pattern.

You can also disable any of the existing tools by removing the tool in the `lib/ai.ts` file.
